<h1>Barnes & Noble Membership Program Terms & Conditions</h1>

<p>These terms and conditions (this "Agreement") govern the Barnes & Noble Member Program. The Barnes & Noble Member Program is a loyalty program brought to you by Barnes & Noble Inc. ("we," "us," "our," "ours"). Purchase or use of any membership in the Barnes & Noble Member Program ("Membership") at any time subjects the purchaser or user ("you," "your," "yours," "Member") to the provisions of this Agreement, as amended from time to time. </p>


<h2>Benefits</h2>

<p>The Barnes & Noble Member Program entitles Members to the following benefits:</p>

<ol type="a">
  	<li>
  	<p>The following everyday discount (the "Everyday Member Discount") on eligible purchases made at stores owned or operated by Barnes & Noble ("Barnes & Noble Stores"), including Ship-to-Home orders placed at Barnes & Noble Stores. </p>
  		<ul>
  			<li>
  				40% off the list price of the current hardcover Barnes & Noble Store Bestsellers. Applies to the 10 fiction hardcover bestsellers and 10 non-fiction hardcover bestsellers based on sales at Barnes & Noble Stores and designated by Barnes & 	Noble from time to time.</li>
  			<li>

	</li>
  
  	<li>
  	<p>The following benefit on eligible purchases made at Barnes & Noble.com ("BN.com") and on ship-to-home orders placed at Barnes & Noble Stores.</p>


	

	<p><strong>Free Express Shipping.</strong> Applies to orders made at BN.com and on Ship-to-Home orders placed at Barnes & Noble Stores, shipped within the continental U.S. only. The following items are not eligible for Free Express Shipping: items purchased from third parties accessible from the BN.com website (e.g., used books, PC and video games, etc.) Gift Cards, Gift Certificates, Magazines, digital content (including but not limited to eBooks, digital magazines and periodicals), SparkNotes and Quamut PDF files, Audiobook MP3s, Barnes & Noble Memberships, unusually sized or overweight items, or any item not identified as eligible for free shipping. Orders shipped to P.O. Boxes and APOs, or to Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico and U.S. Protectorates are not eligible for Express 3-Day shipping but will ship free.</p>


	<p>We do our best to estimate delivery dates for your purchase. The total delivery time it will take for your BN.com order to arrive is a combination of shipping availability time and delivery time. The shipping availability time of products on BN.com tells you how quickly products are expected to be ready to leave our warehouses; this shipping availability is provided on the product detail page. The delivery time means 1-3 business days. For example, when an item is marked "Usually ships within 24 hours," this means the order will leave our warehouse within 24 hours and will arrive within 1-3 business days of leaving our warehouse. <strong>Orders containing pre-ordered items will not ship until ALL items are in stock.</strong></p>


	<p>Business Days are Monday through Friday, excluding holidays observed by the Post Office and UPS, such as New Year's Day, Presidents' Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.</p>


	<p>Delivery times are not guaranteed. Sometimes the availability of the items in your order may change while we are processing your order. In this event, you will receive an email notifying you of a delay, and the remaining eligible items in your order will be shipped as scheduled.</p>
  	</li>

  	<li>
  	<p>Periodic special promotions for Members at Barnes & Noble Stores and at BN.com. </p>
  	</li>

<h2>Membership Fee</h2>


<p>The annual Membership fee is currently $25. Membership fees are subject to taxation in accordance with applicable federal or state law. The annual Membership fee of $25 does not include applicable taxes. We may change the Membership fee at any time, but changes will apply only to new and renewal Memberships.</p>


<p>Membership fees are not refundable. However, we will refund the new or renewal Membership fee within thirty (30) days of the purchase date of the new or renewal Membership or the Automatic Renewal charge date of the Membership, i) if you did not use your Membership to obtain an eligible discount or benefit during the new or renewal Membership term or ii) if your Membership was renewed during your current Membership term and the renewal Membership term has not yet started.</p>




<h2>Term; Automatic Renewal; Billing</h2>

<p>The Membership term is one year, beginning on the date of purchase. A Renewal or Automatic Renewal within a current Membership term extends the existing expiration date of the Membership by one year; such renewal term begins the day after the current term ends. When an expired Membership is renewed, the new Membership term is one year, beginning on the date of renewal.</p>

<p>Each Membership will automatically renew (referred to as "Automatic Renewal Membership") each year for additional one-year periods that commence on the day after the previous term ends unless (i) you have elected to opt-out of Automatic Renewal Membership after your enrollment through your authenticated BN.com account, or by calling Member Services by telephone, at 1-866-238-READ and notifying them of your decision to opt out of Automatic Renewal Membership, (ii) you paid for your Membership with another form of payment, such as cash, in which case you were not opted in to Automatic Renewal Membership, or (iii) your Membership is cancelled or we terminate your Membership.
</p>

<p>You may elect Automatic Renewal Membership at any time by opting in and providing a credit or debit card (other than a debit card that always requires a PIN) through your authenticated BN.com account.</p>


<p>Automatic Renewal Membership fees will be billed annually and automatically to the credit or debit card (other than a debit card that always requires a PIN) you provided when you enrolled in Membership or the form of payment we currently have on file for you, in the amount of the then current Membership fee, approximately one month prior to your Membership expiration date.</p>


<p>When you enroll in Membership in a Barnes & Noble Store and do not opt out of Automatic Renewal prior to your renewal date, or if you have last renewed your Membership in a Barnes & Noble Store and your account shows that you have not opted out of Automatic Renewal, upon your next and subsequent renewals the then current Membership fee will be billed to: (i) the form of payment we currently have on file for you that was used to enroll in the Membership, (ii) the form of payment we currently have on file for you that you provided to us at the time of renewal, or when making a purchase with your Member card at BN.com, or (iii) the form of payment we currently have on file for you that you updated through your authenticated BN.com account, or by calling Member Services at 1-866-238-READ.</p>


<p>When you enroll in Membership online at BN.com, and you do not opt out of Automatic Renewal prior to your renewal date, or you renew your Membership online and you do not opt out of Automatic Renewal, upon your next and subsequent renewals, the then current Membership fee will be billed to: (i) the form of payment we currently have on file for you that was active in your BN.com account at the time of the enrollment or the renewal, (ii) the form of payment we currently have on file for you that you provided to us when making a purchase with your Member card at BN.com, or (iii) the form of payment we currently have on file for you that you updated through an authenticated BN.com account or by calling Member Services at 1-866-238-READ.</p>




<h2>Cancellation; Termination</h2>

<ol type="a">
  	<li>You have the right to cancel your Membership at any time. If you cancel your Membership, you will only be entitled to a full refund of your new or renewal Membership fee within thirty (30) days of the purchase date of the new or renewal Membership or the Automatic Renewal charge date of the Membership, i) if you did not use your Membership to obtain an eligible discount or benefit during the new or renewal Membership term; or ii) if your Membership was renewed during your current Membership term and the renewal Membership term has not yet started. No refunds will be available after such thirty (30) day period (unless we terminate the Barnes & Noble Member Program in its entirety; see subsection below regarding program termination). Subject to the foregoing, you may cancel your Membership by: (i) calling Member Services at 1-866-238-READ, (ii) contacting us via email at membership@barnesandnoble.com, or (iii) presenting your Member card at the Customer Service desk, for Memberships (new or renewed) purchased at Barnes & Noble Stores. 
  	</li>
  	<li>We may terminate your Membership, including any associated accounts, without notice, for any reason in our sole discretion, including without limitation our belief that continued use of such Membership would violate any provisions of this Agreement, applicable law, or otherwise be harmful to our interests. In the event of any such termination, you will not be entitled to a refund of your Membership fee.
  	</li>
  	<li>We may terminate any or all of the benefits available under the Barnes & Noble Member Program at any time with or without notice.
