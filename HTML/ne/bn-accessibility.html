<div class="custom-wrapper"><strong>Our Commitment</strong><br>
 Barnes &amp; Noble is committed to accessibility as part of providing an exceptional experience for our employees, customers, business partners and their families. This includes creating and maintaining digital products and services—including our websites— that are accessible to the widest possible audience, regardless of ability.<br>
<br>
 <strong>Accessibility in Action</strong><br>
 Barnes &amp; Noble's Accessibility Team is dedicated to making accessibility a priority. This philosophy extends to everything we do—from the goods and services we provide to the people we employ in our organization.<br>
<br>
 Accessibility features are built into many of our digital products, including our selection of eReaders. Examples include NOOK Color™, which has adjustable text fonts, sizes and styles as well as customizable line and margin spacing for enhanced readability. Our NOOK Study™ application includes text-to-speech support and global keyboard accessibility for those with cognitive, speech and/or motor impairments.<br>
<br>
 <strong>Ongoing Efforts</strong><br>
 Our job is not done. Barnes &amp; Noble is actively working to increase the usability of our products and services as part of our commitment to continuous improvement. We are listening to your feedback, partnering with relevant organizations and conducting research to ensure we meet existing standards and identify areas of potential concern.<br>
<br>
